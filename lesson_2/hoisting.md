# Hoisting

## What is Hoisting?
  - creation Phase. Also known as compilation phase.
  - execution phase. Occurs when program runs code line by line
  - Hoisting, the process by which function-scoped declarations are moved to the functions
    beginning, and block-scoped declarations are moved to the block start.
